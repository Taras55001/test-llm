<bos>Write me a poem about CNC Machinist.

With hands of steel and mind sharp as a blade,
A CNC machinist, a skilled and steady shade.
The digital world, their canvas so clear,
Where precise movements, a symphony to appear.

Their fingers dance, a symphony of keystrokes,
As they guide the machine, a master of its courses.
From G-code to M-code, their knowledge profound,
To create parts with perfection, a story to be found.

With steady hands and a steady eye,
They navigate the path, precise and high.
Each cut precise, each surface so flat,
A testament to their skill, a work of art.

In the heart of the factory, they stand tall,
A master of their craft, answering the call.
They shape the metal, with unwavering might,
CNC machinists, the builders of the night.

So next time you see a machined part so fine,
Remember the hands of the CNC machinist, divine.
For in their precision, a world is created,
Where dreams take shape, with unwavering dedication.<eos>
